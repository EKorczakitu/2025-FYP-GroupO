# Projects in Data Science (2025)

In this mini project Group O was set to multiple tasks to do. Firstly we had to annotate 100 pictures(1834-1934) based on how hairy they are on a scale of 0-1-2,
and then we had to take the given code from our lectures about how to process these images, to remove the hair and possibly outline the pictured leisions.
At a first glance at the data set we notice that there are many different problems that could make our task harder, like:<br>
<br>
-Blurry pictures(ex 1837 & 2001)<br>
-Huge overlap between hair and leision(ex 1846)<br>
-Pen marks(circling the leision, ex 1847 &2001)<br>
-Foreign spots on the picture(ex 2002)<br>
