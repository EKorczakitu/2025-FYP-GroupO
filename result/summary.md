# Projects in Data Science (2025)

In this mini project Group O was set to multiple tasks to do. Firstly we had to annotate 100 pictures(1834-1934) based on how hairy they are on a scale of 0-1-2,
and then we had to take the given code from our lectures about how to process these images, to remove the hair and possibly outline the pictured leisions.
At a first glance at the data set we notice that there are many different problems that could make our task harder, like:<br>
<br>
-Blurry pictures(ex 1837 & 2001)<br>
-Huge overlap between hair and leision(ex 1846)<br>
-Pen marks(circling the leision, ex 1847 &2001)<br>
-Foreign spots on the picture(ex 2002)<br>
<br>
### Results of hair removal code<br>
We found that our code were able to remove hair really well, but there is cases where more than the hair is removed.<br> 
On the pictures below, we are looking at two senarios where our code removed too much information, leaving the picture with less a than ideal amount of detail.<br>

Below here are some examples of great work done by our code, leaving a good amount of detail.<br>
